                  "ExcursionDetails": "<p>Your hotel is in the heart of the city, so it&rsquo;s easy to see the highlights of the neighborhood on a short, guided walk. Il Duomo, the magnificent cathedral, was born in the 14th century yet finished 500 years later. The last part to be finished, one of its five great doors, wasn&rsquo;t installed until 1965 and offers one of the most spectacular Gothic fa&ccedil;ades in the world. Step inside with a local expert for a tour of the ravishing interior, then walk across the square and under the splendid triumphal arch that welcomes visitors and shoppers into the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele. Learn a bit about the history of this area as you stroll through the beautiful 19th-century glass-covered arcade; it&rsquo;s the oldest shopping mall in Europe and is still wildly popular, housing the flagships of leading fashion designers and trendy restaurants.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll emerge in Piazza della Scala, home to the internationally celebrated opera house whose name comes from the square, Teatro alla Scala. Directly opposite Piazza della Scala is Milan&rsquo;s city hall. A stunning Renaissance palace, it is just one of the palaces and fortresses that were the heart of medieval civic power, where the Viscontis and then the Sforzas reigned, each ruler adding to the city&rsquo;s splendor and tumultuous history.</p>\n<p>With so many highlights, it&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint just one, but Santa Maria delle Grazie, a beautiful Gothic and Renaissance church, offers you a sight you will never forget. <em>The Last Supper </em>is not in the church itself; it adorns the walls of a modest adjoining building that was the Dominican refectory. Your tour ends after you&rsquo;ve had an opportunity to admire Da Vinci&rsquo;s revolutionary work or spend some free time exploring the area on your own.</p>\n<p><em>Note: The order of sightseeing varies according to the availability of time slots at Santa Maria delle Grazie.</em></p>",

Modest farmhouses and great estates alike produce delightful wines, but the Serego Alighieri estate, which belongs to descendants of Dante Alighieri, is one of the oldest and loveliest. The stately villa stands amid gracious gardens and fertile vineyards, welcoming you in for a tour of the grounds and cellars.

Venetians elected their first doge, or duke, in AD 697 and began building the palace around AD 800.</p>\n<p>The palace complex, as it exists now, mostly dates to the 14th and 15th centuries, and it brims with jaw-dropping artistic gems, including Tintoretto&rsquo;s wall-sized <em>Paradise</em> and works by Veronese, Tiepolo and Titian. Throughout its history, Venice has been a supremely political city. Those convicted of crimes were led across the Bridge of Sighs to prison. Follow their footsteps to the prison and gaze into the cells. Casanova escaped from one of these cells. Other less-fortunate prisoners whiled away their time by inscribing graffiti on the walls, which you can still read.</p>\n<p>You will continue this exploration by strolling through the historic Castello district. It&rsquo;s the largest of Venice&rsquo;s six districts. Back in the 13th century the Castello district was home to the Arsenal, where Venice&rsquo;s ships were built. (Venetians boasted that they could build a complete ship in a single day.) This is also where the famous Biennale art exhibition now takes place. As you pass 800-year-old homes, you&rsquo;ll hear the murmur of the soft local dialect through the open windows. Clothes flap from lines strung over tiny canals and kids kick soccer balls along cobbled alleys. It&rsquo;s a real, living, breathing neighborhood, not just a historic site.</p>\n<p>In addition to its well-known museums, Venice is also home to some highly specialized ones: Displays at the Correr are devoted to the history of Venice; the Museo della Musica contains 17th and 18th-century musical instruments and exhibits about composer Antonio Vivaldi. Known as the Red Priest for his hair color, Vivaldi taught music to the daughters of Venetian noblemen. The Museo Ebraico examines the history of the Jewish community that was confined to an island known as Ghetto Nuovo. The latter was one of Europe&rsquo;s wealthiest and most cultured Jewish communities, made up in part with refugees from the Spanish Inquisition.</p>",

                  "ExcursionDetails": "<p>Welcome to Saint Mark&rsquo;s Basilica. The doors of this icon are specially opened for you tonight. You will see the glorious church in the evening light and without the crowds. You&rsquo;ll find it almost impossible not to gaze heavenward as you enter St. Mark&rsquo;s. High overhead, magnificent domes are sheathed in mosaics telling the story of the New Testament, but don&rsquo;t miss the intricate pattern of marble and mosaic tile under your feet. Ahead of you is the famous altarpiece made by 10th-century Byzantine artisans who gilded it and decorated it with precious gems, some of which were subsequently stolen by Napoleon. The building, which exemplifies the city&rsquo;s historic connection to Byzantium and the Eastern Mediterranean, was finished in the 11th century and incorporates the remnants of earlier churches. Golden glass-tiled mosaics line the interior walls and cupolas, giving the church its nickname, Church of Gold. It houses treasures collected by Venetians over the centuries. The relics of St. Mark, patron saint of the city, were stolen from Alexandria, and the Tetrarch, a group of four crowned figures, was looted from Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. Every successful Venetian voyager returned with something to decorate the basilica&mdash;a frieze, a statue&mdash;and the result is one of the most stunning works of art and architecture in this amazing city.</p>\n<p><em>Note: It is not always possible to arrange an after-hours visit to St. Mark&rsquo;s Basilica if religious functions or festivities are taking place in the evening. We will try to organize an earlier tour, but if cancelled, an alternative option, like a visit to San Rocco, will be organized.</em></p>",

Here the Renaissance concept of the ideal city took shape&mdash;it was the first planned city in Italy that did not follow a Roman model&mdash;and as you take a brief walking tour through the historic center, you will see the Estes&rsquo; vision throughout it, from the street layout that parallels the river to the many family palaces.

It was settled before Venice was founded, and at one time it was the greatest, most populous city in the lagoon; now, however, only a handful of people live there. Its centerpiece is the basilica of Santa Maria Assunta, the oldest church in the lagoon and a monument to Torcello&rsquo;s lost might. The doors open early for you so you can see the stunning 11th-century mosaic of the Last Judgment without the crowds&mdash;and with expert commentary from your art historian guide.</p>\n<p>Off to Mazzorbo. Here you&rsquo;ll find a different craft practiced: winemaking. Visit an ambitious wine estate devoted to making wine with Dorona grapes, which tolerate the salt air&mdash;and the occasional saltwater bath during very high tides&mdash;and produce a luscious golden wine. These grapes grew here long ago in a walled vineyard that has been brought back into verdant production. Enjoy a tasting in lovely surroundings.</p>\n<p>Next, let&rsquo;s enjoy a rainbow of Italian history. Hot pink, chartreuse, orange, lemon yellow&mdash;Burano&rsquo;s brightly painted fishermen&rsquo;s cottages are an artist&rsquo;s dream. The sizzling colors may look random, but they are strictly regulated: An owner needs state permission to change the color of the house. Burano is even better known for its lace-making tradition than for its colors; the exquisite craft has been practiced here for 400 years, handed down from mother to daughter since the first workshop was set up at the end of the 16th century. Visit a historic lace-making atelier to see some of this delicate work and, if you like, purchase items to take home.</p>",

Though a Renaissance man on all counts as a philosopher, Freemason, alchemist, spy and adventurer, his many romantic affairs are what he is best known for. Your tour of the city will take you through various spots in town that were significant to his life as you learn about his singular history.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll begin in the San Samuele district, where Casanova was born to two actors playing at a theater near the Palazzo Malipiero. You will then reach Campo San Maurizio, with its leaning bell tower. Giorgio Baffo, Casanova&rsquo;s mentor and Venetian judge known for his erotic poetry, lived here in the palace on the right side. Baffo introduced Casanova to the seduction rites.</p>\n<p>A few steps further and you will be in San Mois&egrave; Square, the former site of a casino where Casanova used to meet his lovers. The next stop will be the Ridotto in Calle Vallaresso. Now a hotel, it was once a place where Giacomo Casanova and his contemporaries used to gamble&mdash;it is said that Casanova lost a fortune here.</p>\n<p>Crossing into St. Mark&rsquo;s Square, you will pass by the prisons of the Doge&rsquo;s Palace, in which Casanova was imprisoned until 1756 when he escaped to France. He was permitted to return in 1774, but was exiled again within a decade for publishing a novel considered outrageously offensive by the Venetian authorities. Our last stop for the day will be the Palazzo Grimani of Santa Maria Formosa, where Casanova was hosted until this novel was published.</p>",

      "Description": "Uncover the enchanted beauty and breathtaking history of Venice and Northern Italy.\r\n\r\nBegin your journey in stunning Milan and disembark in romantic Venice. These two legendary cities (Milan—home to Da Vinci’s The Last Supper, and Venice—the “Queen of the Adriatic”) will bookend unforgettable experiences set along Northern Italy’s exquisite coastline.\r\n\r\nTravel from dynamic Milan to romantic Venice and treat yourself to a private evening opening and lighting ceremony at St. Mark’s Basilica. Depart the enchanting “City of Water” to explore the waterfront shops, colorful facades and peaceful canals unique to Burano, Mazzorbo and Torcello. Farther south, discover Chioggia—a charming southern port loved by fishermen, artists and anyone looking for unique gifts or souvenirs. Head inland to enjoy a multicourse lunch, complete with decadent wine pairings, at a historic wine estate in the vineyards of Valpolicella. Enjoy additional shopping time in “bountiful” Bologna and medieval Padua, once home to Galileo and Copernicus.

                  "ExcursionDetails": "<p><em>Please note that the amount of walking during this excursion is extensive.</em></p>\n<p>Venice has no need to designate a pedestrians-only historic district because no cars are permitted within the island city - all transportation is by foot or water.</p>\n<p>You first arrive at the Doge&rsquo;s Palace and most famous plaza in Italy - St. Mark&rsquo;s Square. Venetians elected their first doge, or duke, in AD 697 and began building the palace around AD 800.</p>\n<p>The palace complex, as it exists now, mostly dates to the 14th and 15th centuries, and it brims with jaw-dropping artistic gems, including Tintoretto&rsquo;s wall-sized <em>Paradise</em> and works by Veronese, Tiepolo and Titian. Throughout its history, Venice has been a supremely political city. Those convicted of crimes were led across the Bridge of Sighs to prison. Follow their footsteps to the prison and gaze into the cells. Casanova escaped from one of these cells. Other less-fortunate prisoners whiled away their time by inscribing graffiti on the walls, which you can still read.</p>\n<p>You will continue this exploration by strolling through the historic Castello district. It&rsquo;s the largest of Venice&rsquo;s six districts. Back in the 13th century the Castello district was home to the Arsenal, where Venice&rsquo;s ships were built. (Venetians boasted that they could build a complete ship in a single day.) This is also where the famous Biennale art exhibition now takes place. As you pass 800-year-old homes, you&rsquo;ll hear the murmur of the soft local dialect through the open windows. Clothes flap from lines strung over tiny canals and kids kick soccer balls along cobbled alleys. It&rsquo;s a real, living, breathing neighborhood, not just a historic site.</p>\n<p>In addition to its well-known museums, Venice is also home to some highly specialized ones: Displays at the Correr are devoted to the history of Venice; the Museo della Musica contains 17th and 18th-century musical instruments and exhibits about composer Antonio Vivaldi. Known as the Red Priest for his hair color, Vivaldi taught music to the daughters of Venetian noblemen. The Museo Ebraico examines the history of the Jewish community that was confined to an island known as Ghetto Nuovo. The latter was one of Europe&rsquo;s wealthiest and most cultured Jewish communities, made up in part with refugees from the Spanish Inquisition.</p>",

                  "ExcursionDetails": "<p>Welcome to Saint Mark&rsquo;s Basilica. The doors of this icon are specially opened for you tonight. You will see the glorious church in the evening light and without the crowds. You&rsquo;ll find it almost impossible not to gaze heavenward as you enter St. Mark&rsquo;s. High overhead, magnificent domes are sheathed in mosaics telling the story of the New Testament, but don&rsquo;t miss the intricate pattern of marble and mosaic tile under your feet. Ahead of you is the famous altarpiece made by 10th-century Byzantine artisans who gilded it and decorated it with precious gems, some of which were subsequently stolen by Napoleon. The building, which exemplifies the city&rsquo;s historic connection to Byzantium and the Eastern Mediterranean, was finished in the 11th century and incorporates the remnants of earlier churches. Golden glass-tiled mosaics line the interior walls and cupolas, giving the church its nickname, Church of Gold. It houses treasures collected by Venetians over the centuries. The relics of St. Mark, patron saint of the city, were stolen from Alexandria, and the Tetrarch, a group of four crowned figures, was looted from Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. Every successful Venetian voyager returned with something to decorate the basilica&mdash;a frieze, a statue&mdash;and the result is one of the most stunning works of art and architecture in this amazing city.</p>\n<p><em>Note: It is not always possible to arrange an after-hours visit to St. Mark&rsquo;s Basilica if religious functions or festivities are taking place in the evening. We will try to organize an earlier tour, but if cancelled, an alternative option, like a visit to San Rocco, will be organized.</em></p>",

Bologna&rsquo;s green market brims with local produce, and its specialty food stores and food halls are unmatched; locally made mortadella, luscious balsamic vinegar from nearby Modena, ham from Parma and, of course, great rounds of Parmesan cheese all contribute to the lavish displays. Stroll with your guide under the famous arcades to see some of the lovely, historic buildings in the city center. The huge basilica dates to the 14th century, and the two leaning towers that loom above Piazza di Porta Ravegnana were built in the 12th century, as were the structures that housed Europe&rsquo;s first university. Participate in a workshop on making pasta and enjoy an exquisite Bolognese lunch at a celebrated restaurant. Sated with food and culture, it will then be time to head back to the ship.</p>",

They turned Ferrara into a center for the arts and artists&mdash;particularly for musicians and composers&mdash;that rivaled Medici Florence. Here the Renaissance concept of the ideal city took shape&mdash;it was the first planned city in Italy that did not follow a Roman model&mdash;and as you take a brief walking tour through the historic center, you will see the Estes&rsquo; vision throughout it, from the street layout that parallels the river to the many family palaces. But not all of Ferrara is Renaissance: The medieval walls still surround the old city (providing a popular walking and biking route for locals and visitors alike), the Gothic cathedral dates to the 12th century, and tiny cobbled lanes might make you think you were visiting the Middle Ages&mdash;were it not for the bicycles that Ferrara&rsquo;s citizens ride everywhere. Your local expert will introduce you to the highlights of Ferrara, and you&rsquo;ll have some time to explore on your own before returning to the ship for lunch.</p>",

                  "ExcursionDetails": "<p>The Venetian lagoon is dotted with islands, each with its own history, heritage and charm.</p>\n<p>Welcome to Torcello. It was settled before Venice was founded, and at one time it was the greatest, most populous city in the lagoon; now, however, only a handful of people live there. Its centerpiece is the basilica of Santa Maria Assunta, the oldest church in the lagoon and a monument to Torcello&rsquo;s lost might. The doors open early for you so you can see the stunning 11th-century mosaic of the Last Judgment without the crowds&mdash;and with expert commentary from your art historian guide.</p>\n<p>Off to Mazzorbo. Here you&rsquo;ll find a different craft practiced: winemaking. Visit an ambitious wine estate devoted to making wine with Dorona grapes, which tolerate the salt air&mdash;and the occasional saltwater bath during very high tides&mdash;and produce a luscious golden wine. These grapes grew here long ago in a walled vineyard that has been brought back into verdant production. Enjoy a tasting in lovely surroundings.</p>\n<p>Next, let&rsquo;s enjoy a rainbow of Italian history. Hot pink, chartreuse, orange, lemon yellow&mdash;Burano&rsquo;s brightly painted fishermen&rsquo;s cottages are an artist&rsquo;s dream. The sizzling colors may look random, but they are strictly regulated: An owner needs state permission to change the color of the house. Burano is even better known for its lace-making tradition than for its colors; the exquisite craft has been practiced here for 400 years, handed down from mother to daughter since the first workshop was set up at the end of the 16th century. Visit a historic lace-making atelier to see some of this delicate work and, if you like, purchase items to take home.</p>",

Here you&rsquo;ll find violet artichokes from the nearby island of Sant&rsquo;Erasmo, honey from the salt marshes, white asparagus from Giare&mdash;and Venetians shopping for their dinners in the historic heart of the city. Join them as you explore the colorful, noisy and fun arcades with your guide (the ship&rsquo;s chef often accompanies this expedition), who knows Venice&rsquo;s culinary arts intimately. Freshly caught local fish is sold to knowledgeable customers under the Gothic arches of the covered fish market, which was probably originally built in the 11th century. At the end of the tour (and after some free time where you should have plenty of time to enjoy a gondola ride), join your guide at a <em>bacaro</em> (a casual wine bar) for the Venetian version of happy hour, called <em>ombra e cicchetti</em>&mdash;a drink (often a glass of prosecco) with a bite of something delicious&mdash;perhaps crostini with salt cod spread or another Venetian fish specialty.</p>",

                  "ExcursionDetails": "<p>Giacomo Casanova, born in 1725, is one of the most notorious names to ever come out of Venice. Though a Renaissance man on all counts as a philosopher, Freemason, alchemist, spy and adventurer, his many romantic affairs are what he is best known for. Your tour of the city will take you through various spots in town that were significant to his life as you learn about his singular history.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll begin in the San Samuele district, where Casanova was born to two actors playing at a theater near the Palazzo Malipiero. You will then reach Campo San Maurizio, with its leaning bell tower. Giorgio Baffo, Casanova&rsquo;s mentor and Venetian judge known for his erotic poetry, lived here in the palace on the right side. Baffo introduced Casanova to the seduction rites.</p>\n<p>A few steps further and you will be in San Mois&egrave; Square, the former site of a casino where Casanova used to meet his lovers. The next stop will be the Ridotto in Calle Vallaresso. Now a hotel, it was once a place where Giacomo Casanova and his contemporaries used to gamble&mdash;it is said that Casanova lost a fortune here.</p>\n<p>Crossing into St. Mark&rsquo;s Square, you will pass by the prisons of the Doge&rsquo;s Palace, in which Casanova was imprisoned until 1756 when he escaped to France. He was permitted to return in 1774, but was exiled again within a decade for publishing a novel considered outrageously offensive by the Venetian authorities. Our last stop for the day will be the Palazzo Grimani of Santa Maria Formosa, where Casanova was hosted until this novel was published.</p>",

Many of these captains traveled to far-off places and returned with exotic plants, which they planted in their gardens and along the road (hence the route&rsquo;s name). But the history of these cliffs extends far beyond the 19th century&mdash;people have inhabited the area for thousands of years.</p>\n<p>Upon returning to Blaye, your guide will take you through the 17th-century demilune-shaped citadel built by famed military engineer Vauban. This fortress design was the one Vauban, Louis XIV&rsquo;s favorite military engineer, found most satisfactory, and he built some 300 of them in the Sun King&rsquo;s realm. The citadel contains the ruins of a medieval castle, houses, squares, streets, even a convent, all enclosed within stark walls. If you stand on top of those walls, you will have a terrific view of the estuary&mdash; this view was the field of fire, giving the citadel command of the river.</p>",

Today R&eacute;my Martin uses fine Champagne to produce its fine cognac, blending a variety of eaux de vie and aging them in oak barrels that might be 200 years old. (Remy Martin&rsquo;s legendary&mdash;and legendarily expensive&mdash; Louis XIII cognac has been called &ldquo;One Century in a Bottle&rdquo; precisely because of that extraordinary aging process.)

Of all the sights, however, perhaps the most extraordinary is the 12th-century church carved into a cliff. Only the tower is above ground; the rest of the church is subterranean. Its numerous underground galleries provided refuge during periods of strife, and include the grotto where St. &Eacute;milion, for whom the town is named, lived out his life in the ninth century. You have to see it for yourself&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be amazed by its almost unfathomable construction. After touring Saint-&Eacute;milion, you&rsquo;ll visit the cellars of a premier Grand Cru estate where you&rsquo;ll taste some of the world&rsquo;s most highly rated wines.</p>\n<p>Note:&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s lunch will be on your own.</p>",

Though Bordeaux was the capital of Aquitaine in the Middle Ages and has its share of Gothic churches, it reached its apex in the 18th century. The splendid honey-colored stone buildings from this era make up a city core that UNESCO has designated a World Heritage Site (this is the district that inspired Baron Haussmann when he redesigned Paris at the behest of Napoleon III). Trade with the French colonies built this handsome district, furnishing vanilla, sugar, spices and cocoa to inventive chocolatiers and bakers, who used these goods to create iconic desserts. Chocolate, once a Spanish monopoly, became part of Bordeaux&rsquo; culinary heritage when banished Spanish Jews brought the art of chocolate-making to France. What are Bordeaux&rsquo; present-day residents enjoying when they step inside the luxurious food halls and elegant shops in this neighborhood? Find out as you sample the delicious handiwork of Bordeaux&rsquo; bakers, as well as cheeses and chocolates&mdash;learn a few recipes, too! You&rsquo;ll also visit one of the city&rsquo;s wine bars and see first-hand how the wines of the many local ch&acirc;teaux are enjoyed by today&rsquo;s sophisticated clients.</p>",

Pause before the town hall, built with stone quarried from the Roman theater, and the Romanesque St. Trophime Church, which was erected in the 12th century. It replaced the church where St. Augustine, the man who converted the inhabitants of England to Christianity, was consecrated by the first archbishop of Canterbury. Walk in Van Gogh&rsquo;s footsteps past the cheery yellow Caf&eacute; de Nuit&mdash;still open and still the same shade of yellow it was when he painted it&mdash;and across Forum Square before visiting the town&rsquo;s bountiful farmers&rsquo; market, which displays seasonal fruits and vegetables, medicinal herbs and many more specialties of Southern France.</p>\n<p>During your free time after the tour, you can peruse the local shops, go olive tasting or delve further into Arles&rsquo; stunning collection of architectural treasures.</p>",

This area was the heart of medieval Avignon (and the site of the original Roman town), crowded with cottages and narrow streets&mdash;until a pope had it all demolished in order to give his troops a clearer field of fire. That is Avignon in a nutshell: It was the city of the popes. The Avignon popes built the ramparts that still surround the Old Town and the huge, nearly impregnable fortress that dominates the UNESCO-designated district; in fact, the city did not officially become part of France until 1791. Stand below the high, thick walls to get a sense of just how daunting these fortifications were, then prepare to climb many steps as you tour the Palace of the Popes itself&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth it!</p>",

                  "ExcursionDetails": "<p>In the middle of the first century, Roman engineers responded to N&icirc;mes&rsquo;s need for water to fill its baths, fountains and pools by building a 30-mile-long aqueduct from Uz&egrave;s to N&icirc;mes&mdash;which required transporting Uz&egrave;s springwater over the River Gardon. A thousand workers quarried 50,000 tons of soft golden limestone and used it to construct&mdash;without mortar&mdash;the magnificent tri-level bridge that still spans the river. An expert guide will explain the techniques used to build this engineering marvel, which has withstood 2,000 years of floods and storms that swept away much newer bridges. You can see notations those ancient Romans made in the stones as they cut and fitted them into place when you view the bridge itself, and you can learn about the entire project at the museum. The UNESCO World Heritage Site is as beautiful as it is fascinating.</p>",

The Gothic cathedral is probably the most striking heirloom of the Middle Ages, but the tall rose and ocher buildings dating to the Renaissance pay tribute to the importance of the silk trade with Italy in that era. Enter the courtyard of the Gadagne Museum, which is housed in an early 16th-century building, and stroll along Rue Juiverie, which has been occupied since Roman times and was once home to Nostradamus. You&rsquo;ll see some of the traboules, the old passageways that snake between and through buildings, secret shortcuts that silk weavers took to keep their delicate fabrics out of the rain. You&rsquo;ll pass cozy bouchons, which serve traditional local dishes, and you&rsquo;ll have a chance to see a Jacquard loom in use.</p>",

Lyon boasts a thriving bike-rental scene, which tells you just how popular this mode of transportation is&mdash;you will definitely have two-wheeled company as you pedal along the banks of the Rh&ocirc;ne on a sunny day. Your route takes you over the new Raymond Barre Bridge, past the spectacular new Museum of Confluences (so named because it sits at the confluence of the Rh&ocirc;ne and the Sa&ocirc;ne) and along the peninsula, a strip of land with the Sa&ocirc;ne on one side and the Rh&ocirc;ne on the other. Here, houseboats tie up along the banks, swans float on the water and locals take advantage of the lovely park like setting. You&rsquo;ll also have a great view of the Old Town on the other side of the river. This outing gives you a little taste of what it is like to live in Lyon, as well as a little exercise.</p>",

Nestled inside medieval ramparts, Beaune was the seat of the warlike dukes of Burgundy until the 16th century. It is best known for two magnificent sights: the Hospices de Beaune and the open-air market.</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll recognize the Hospices de Beaune (also known as H&ocirc;tel-Dieu) immediately by its fabulous multicolored-tile roof&mdash;it&rsquo;s a symbol of Burgundy. Founded as a charitable institution by the duke&rsquo;s chancellor in 1443, the hospital became a model for charitable giving in southern France, one with a unique fundraising tradition that continues to this day. Over the centuries, the hospice monks were given wine and vineyards, and they began selling the wine at auction in order to support their charitable work. The wine auction is now world-famous, and the institution remains a working hospital for the poor, with modern facilities standing alongside the historic H&ocirc;tel-Dieu.After seeing H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, check out the farmers&rsquo; market, which spills from street to street in the Old Town. Cheeses, fruits, vegetables, local sausages, breads&mdash;all are on colorful display here. Browse and assemble your own picnic lunch or take advantage of one of the many delightful sidewalk caf&eacute;s for lunch.</p>\n<p><em>Note: The open-air farmers&rsquo; market visit will take place in Arles on the reverse direction cruise (Lyon to Avignon).</em></p>\n<p><em>Note:&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s lunch will be on your own.</em></p>",

Alphonse de Lamartine, born a year after the French revolution began, became the country&rsquo;s first Romantic poet and a celebrated man of letters&mdash;and, in 1848, a founder of the Second Republic. You&rsquo;ll spot his statue opposite M&acirc;con&rsquo;s city hall as you stroll from the ship with your guide through this historic riverport city, which has been an important trading center since the Celts founded it 2,200 years ago. The Romans built a bridge across the Saone here, and you&rsquo;ll have a great view of its 16th-century successor, the graceful multi-arched St. Laurent bridge, from the square. Ramble down Rue Monrevel for a look at the twin towers of St. Peter&rsquo;s, the church that replaced M&acirc;con&rsquo;s medieval&mdash;and irreparable&mdash;cathedral and then along bustling Rue Carnot, lined with shops and cafes, to a curious wooden house that predates the bridge: Maison de Bois&rsquo; facade is decorated with carved figures of men and monkeys&mdash;standing, sitting, holding onto mythical beasts. It&rsquo;s the oldest house in M&acirc;con, built around the year 1500, and one of just a few remaining examples of this rustic medieval style of architecture.</p>\n<p><em>Note:&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s lunch will be on your own.</em></p>",

Alphonse de Lamartine, born a year after the French revolution began, became the country&rsquo;s first Romantic poet and a celebrated man of letters&mdash;and, in 1848, a founder of the Second Republic. You&rsquo;ll spot his statue opposite M&acirc;con&rsquo;s city hall as you stroll from the ship with your guide through this historic riverport city, which has been an important trading center since the Celts founded it 2,200 years ago. The Romans built a bridge across the Saone here, and you&rsquo;ll have a great view of its 16th-century successor, the graceful multi-arched St. Laurent bridge, from the square. Ramble down Rue Monrevel for a look at the twin towers of St. Peter&rsquo;s, the church that replaced M&acirc;con&rsquo;s medieval&mdash;and irreparable&mdash;cathedral and then along bustling Rue Carnot, lined with shops and cafes, to a curious wooden house that predates the bridge: Maison de Bois&rsquo; facade is decorated with carved figures of men and monkeys&mdash;standing, sitting, holding onto mythical beasts. It&rsquo;s the oldest house in M&acirc;con, built around the year 1500, and one of just a few remaining examples of this rustic medieval style of architecture.</p>\n<p><em>Note:&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s lunch will be on your own.</em></p>",

Founded as a charitable institution by the duke&rsquo;s chancellor in 1443, the hospital became a model for charitable giving in southern France, one with a unique fundraising tradition that continues to this day. Over the centuries, the hospice monks were given wine and vineyards, and they began selling the wine at auction in order to support their charitable work. The wine auction is now world-famous, and the institution remains a working hospital for the poor, with modern facilities standing alongside the historic H&ocirc;tel-Dieu.</p>\n<p><em>Note:&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s lunch will be on your own.</em></p>",

The Gothic cathedral is probably the most striking heirloom of the Middle Ages, but the tall rose and ocher buildings dating to the Renaissance pay tribute to the importance of the silk trade with Italy in that era. Enter the courtyard of the Gadagne Museum, which is housed in an early16th- century building, and stroll along Rue Juiverie, which has been occupied since Roman times and was once home to Nostradamus. You&rsquo;ll see some of the traboules, the old passageways that snake between and through buildings, secret shortcuts that silk weavers took to keep their delicate fabrics out of the rain. You&rsquo;ll pass cozy bouchons, which serve traditional local dishes, and you&rsquo;ll have a chance to see a Jacquard loom in use.</p>",

This area was the heart of medieval Avignon (and the site of the original Roman town), crowded with cottages and narrow streets&mdash;until a pope had it all demolished in order to give his troops a clearer field of fire. That is Avignon in a nutshell: It was the city of the popes. The Avignon popes built the ramparts that still surround the Old Town and the huge, nearly impregnable fortress that dominates the UNESCO-designated district; in fact, the city did not officially become part of France until 1791. Stand below the high, thick walls to get a sense of just how daunting these fortifications were, then prepare to climb many steps as you tour the Palace of the Popes itself&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth it!</p>",

A thousand workers quarried 50,000 tons of soft golden limestone and used it to construct&mdash;without mortar&mdash;the magnificent tri-level bridge that still spans the river. An expert guide will explain the techniques used to build this engineering marvel, which has withstood 2,000 years of floods and storms that swept away much newer bridges. You can see notations those ancient Romans made in the stones as they cut and fitted them into place when you view the bridge itself, and you can learn about the entire project at the museum. The UNESCO World Heritage Site is as beautiful as it is fascinating.</p>",

Pause before the town hall, built with stone quarried from the Roman theater, and the Romanesque St. Trophime Church, which was erected in the 12th century. It replaced the church where St. Augustine, the man who converted the inhabitants of England to Christianity, was consecrated by the first archbishop of Canterbury. Walk in Van Gogh&rsquo;s footsteps past the cheery yellow Caf&eacute; de Nuit&mdash;still open and still the same shade of yellow it was when he painted it&mdash;and across Forum Square before visiting the town&rsquo;s bountiful farmers&rsquo; market, which displays seasonal fruits and vegetables, medicinal herbs and many more specialties of Southern France.</p>\n<p>During your free time after the tour, you can peruse the local shops, go olive tasting or delve further into Arles&rsquo; stunning collection of architectural treasures.</p>",

Medieval knights kept watch for marauding Vikings from the tower high atop the hill and later defended the double wall around a 13th-century manor house; successive lords added to the buildings over the centuries, so you can see not just troglodyte chapels but Renaissance rooms where kings Francis I and Henry II were entertained (and, legend says, Henry IV pursued a lovely chatelaine without success) and handsome 18th-century state apartments. Enlightenment thinkers met with the Duchess d&rsquo;Enville, who owned the ch&acirc;teau before the revolution and who had the huge kitchen garden laid out according to Enlightenment principles. You might think, as you walk through the elegantly designed garden and beautifully paneled rooms (mostly without furniture these days, so you can appreciate the Gobelins tapestries without distraction) that the residence&rsquo;s military function was in the far distant past, but Rommel made his headquarters here during WWII, precisely because the ancient fortifications and caves were so secure.</p>",

As you stroll through the grounds, you&rsquo;ll see the famed Japanese bridge and water garden shaded by weeping willows. Monet&rsquo;s house, which you will also visit, remains furnished as it was when the leader of the impressionist school lived here, complete with his precious collection of Japanese engravings.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Giverny will be closed during the March and November cruise departure dates.</em></p>",

If you are experiencing Paris for the first time, this tour will introduce you to the City of Light&rsquo;s most cherished landmarks. You&rsquo;ll head via motorcoach from the Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by Napoleon to celebrate his Grand Army&rsquo;s 128 victories, down the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es to the Place de la Concorde. These broad 19th-century avenues and stately buildings were created by Baron Haussmann in a great urban development that eliminated the cramped, crazy-quilt medieval city and gave Paris its modern form. You&rsquo;ll pass the magnificent Op&eacute;ra Garnier, the Place Vend&ocirc;me (home to designer salons), the legendary Louvre and, on the Left Bank, the Sorbonne University and the Panth&eacute;on. Stretch your legs at the Luxembourg Gardens, then take in the &Eacute;cole Militaire before arriving at the manicured grounds of the Champs de Mars, the perfect vantage point from which to see Paris&rsquo;s most iconic structure&mdash;the Eiffel Tower. Cross the Seine via the most stunning single-arch bridge in Paris, Pont Alexandre III; it displays elegantly sculpted nymphs, winged horses and graceful art nouveau lamps. Once on the other side of the river, you&rsquo;ll be sure to spot the largest glass ceilings in France, which shelter the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais. As you continue along the Seine&rsquo;s banks you&rsquo;ll see many striking contemporary bridges too. Your city tour will finish at your ship&rsquo;s dock.</p>",

Henry IV said that Paris was worth a Mass when he converted to Catholicism&mdash;and he made that conversion official here, in the center of Paris. In fact, Notre Dame is officially the center of France; facing its main entrance is Kilometer Zero, the location from which distances in France (including those of the French national highways) are traditionally measured. An expert in the history and architecture of this magnificent cathedral will be your guide. Begun in the 12th century and finished about 200 years later, Notre Dame is one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in Europe.</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve admired Notre Dame&rsquo;s stained glass, flying buttresses and idiosyncratic gargoyles, cross the Archbishop&rsquo;s Bridge to the Left Bank and the Latin Quarter. Wander through the narrow streets where for centuries artists, writers, philosophers and the Sorbonne&rsquo;s students have lived and worked, argued politics, painted, sipped absinthe and lived the bohemian lifestyle for which the district is famous. Matisse, Picasso, Rimbaud and Sartre, as well as American expatriate writers Hemingway and Fitzgerald, are just a few of the notables who made this district home. Take some time to meander through the area&rsquo;s little squares, perusing the shop windows and perhaps relaxing with a drink at a classic caf&eacute;.</p>",

Many of these captains traveled to far-off places and returned with exotic plants, which they planted in their gardens and along the road (hence the route&rsquo;s name). But the history of these cliffs extends far beyond the 19th century&mdash;people have inhabited the area for thousands of years.</p>\n<p>Upon returning to Blaye, your guide will take you through the 17th-century demilune-shaped citadel built by famed military engineer Vauban. This fortress design was the one Vauban, Louis XIV&rsquo;s favorite military engineer, found most satisfactory, and he built some 300 of them in the Sun King&rsquo;s realm. The citadel contains the ruins of a medieval castle, houses, squares, streets, even a convent, all enclosed within stark walls. If you stand on top of those walls, you will have a terrific view of the estuary&mdash; this view was the field of fire, giving the citadel command of the river.</p>",

Today R&eacute;my Martin uses fine Champagne to produce its fine cognac, blending a variety of eaux de vie and aging them in oak barrels that might be 200 years old. (Remy Martin&rsquo;s legendary&mdash;and legendarily expensive&mdash; Louis XIII cognac has been called &ldquo;One Century in a Bottle&rdquo; precisely because of that extraordinary aging process.)

You might be surprised to discover that the peninsula is only three miles wide, though it is 50 miles long, and the road carries you past a dizzying array of architectural styles&mdash; Renaissance, Greek Revival and medieval&mdash;as well as miles of grapevines. You&rsquo;ll turn off the road and enter one of these estates for a private tour and a tasting of premier Grand Cru wines&mdash;but you won&rsquo;t know which one of these exceptional ch&acirc;teaux is your destination until you open your invitation.</p>",

Its numerous underground galleries provided refuge during periods of strife, and include the grotto where St. &Eacute;milion, for whom the town is named, lived out his life in the ninth century.

                  "ExcursionDetails": "<p>Catch a tram at the Quai des Chartrons to the Place de la Com&eacute;die, the heart of Bordeaux&rsquo; Golden Triangle. Though Bordeaux was the capital of Aquitaine in the Middle Ages and has its share of Gothic churches, it reached its apex in the 18th century. The splendid honey-colored stone buildings from this era make up a city core that UNESCO has designated a World Heritage Site (this is the district that inspired Baron Haussmann when he redesigned Paris at the behest of Napoleon III). Trade with the French colonies built this handsome district, furnishing vanilla, sugar, spices and cocoa to inventive chocolatiers and bakers, who used these goods to create iconic desserts. Chocolate, once a Spanish monopoly, became part of Bordeaux&rsquo; culinary heritage when banished Spanish Jews brought the art of chocolate-making to France. What are Bordeaux&rsquo; present-day residents enjoying when they step inside the luxurious food halls and elegant shops in this neighborhood? Find out as you sample the delicious handiwork of Bordeaux&rsquo; bakers, as well as cheeses and chocolates&mdash;learn a few recipes, too! You&rsquo;ll also visit one of the city&rsquo;s wine bars and see first-hand how the wines of the many local ch&acirc;teaux are enjoyed by today&rsquo;s sophisticated clients.</p>",

Medieval knights kept watch for marauding Vikings from the tower high atop the hill and later defended the double wall around a 13th-century manor house; successive lords added to the buildings over the centuries, so you can see not just troglodyte chapels but Renaissance rooms where kings Francis I and Henry II were entertained (and, legend says, Henry IV pursued a lovely chatelaine without success) and handsome 18th-century state apartments. Enlightenment thinkers met with the Duchess d&rsquo;Enville, who owned the ch&acirc;teau before the revolution and who had the huge kitchen garden laid out according to Enlightenment principles. You might think, as you walk through the elegantly designed garden and beautifully paneled rooms (mostly without furniture these days, so you can appreciate the Gobelins tapestries without distraction) that the residence&rsquo;s military function was in the far distant past, but Rommel made his headquarters here during WWII, precisely because the ancient fortifications and caves were so secure.</p>",

Your local guide will take you down tiny lanes, where houses stand shoulder to shoulder in a jumble of styles: narrow 19th-century slate-roofed townhouses, 15th-century fishermen&rsquo;s cottages, and tall and elegant mansions&mdash; many adorned with figures of chimeras or saints. You&rsquo;ll also see St. Catherine&rsquo;s Church, built in the 15th century by shipwrights who gave it an oak ceiling that looks like the hull of a boat.</p>",

Spend the morning on the course, lunch on your own in charming &Eacute;tretat and explore the seaside village that so many artists, including Monet, rendered in paint, or return to the ship for lunch and a leisurely afternoon onboard.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Golf excursion is open to a limited number of golfers.

You&rsquo;ll head via motorcoach from the Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by Napoleon to celebrate his Grand Army&rsquo;s 128 victories, down the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es to the Place de la Concorde. These broad 19th-century avenues and stately buildings were created by Baron Haussmann in a great urban development that eliminated the cramped, crazy-quilt medieval city and gave Paris its modern form. You&rsquo;ll pass the magnificent Op&eacute;ra Garnier, the Place Vend&ocirc;me (home to designer salons), the legendary Louvre and, on the Left Bank, the Sorbonne University and the Panth&eacute;on. Stretch your legs at the Luxembourg Gardens, then take in the &Eacute;cole Militaire before arriving at the manicured grounds of the Champs de Mars, the perfect vantage point from which to see Paris&rsquo;s most iconic structure&mdash;the Eiffel Tower. Cross the Seine via the most stunning single-arch bridge in Paris, Pont Alexandre III; it displays elegantly sculpted nymphs, winged horses and graceful art nouveau lamps. Once on the other side of the river, you&rsquo;ll be sure to spot the largest glass ceilings in France, which shelter the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais. As you continue along the Seine&rsquo;s banks you&rsquo;ll see many striking contemporary bridges too. Your city tour will finish at your ship&rsquo;s dock.</p>",

In fact, Notre Dame is officially the center of France; facing its main entrance is Kilometer Zero, the location from which distances in France (including those of the French national highways) are traditionally measured. An expert in the history and architecture of this magnificent cathedral will be your guide. Begun in the 12th century and finished about 200 years later, Notre Dame is one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in Europe.</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve admired Notre Dame&rsquo;s stained glass, flying buttresses and idiosyncratic gargoyles, cross the Archbishop&rsquo;s Bridge to the Left Bank and the Latin Quarter. Wander through the narrow streets where for centuries artists, writers, philosophers and the Sorbonne&rsquo;s students have lived and worked, argued politics, painted, sipped absinthe and lived the bohemian lifestyle for which the district is famous. Matisse, Picasso, Rimbaud and Sartre, as well as American expatriate writers Hemingway and Fitzgerald, are just a few of the notables who made this district home.

Join a guide to pedal along the Left Bank, crossing the bridges that link historic &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute; and &Icirc;le Saint-Louis and getting a close look at the heart of the city&rsquo;s origins. Bike to the Esplanade des Invalides (Napoleon&rsquo;s tomb is one of the monuments here) and along the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay to the Champs de Mars, one of Paris&rsquo;s largest green spaces . . . which just happens to have one of the best views of the Eiffel Tower in the city. It&rsquo;s a fun way to take part in the life of the city while also getting some exercise.</p>",

Medieval knights kept watch for marauding Vikings from the tower high atop the hill and later defended the double wall around a 13th-century manor house; successive lords added to the buildings over the centuries, so you can see not just troglodyte chapels but Renaissance rooms where kings Francis I and Henry II were entertained (and, legend says, Henry IV pursued a lovely chatelaine without success) and handsome 18th-century state apartments. Enlightenment thinkers met with the Duchess d&rsquo;Enville, who owned the ch&acirc;teau before the revolution and who had the huge kitchen garden laid out according to Enlightenment principles. You might think, as you walk through the elegantly designed garden and beautifully paneled rooms (mostly without furniture these days, so you can appreciate the Gobelins tapestries without distraction) that the residence&rsquo;s military function was in the far distant past, but Rommel made his headquarters here during WWII, precisely because the ancient fortifications and caves were so secure.</p>",

When Monet bought the property, most of it was an orchard; he transformed it over the years into the enchanting visions immortalized in his paintings, essentially creating each work of art twice: once as a living garden and again as a painting. As you stroll through the grounds, you&rsquo;ll see the famed Japanese bridge and water garden shaded by weeping willows. Monet&rsquo;s house, which you will also visit, remains furnished as it was when the leader of the impressionist school lived here, complete with his precious collection of Japanese engravings.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Giverny will be closed during the March and November cruise departure dates.</em></p>",

Tour the royal apartments, which still look much as they did when Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette fled in 1789. In these rooms, you&rsquo;ll find lush silk draperies, exquisite marquetry tables, gilded beds, Aubusson carpets and porcelain ornaments that reveal the elegance of the 18th-century royalty&rsquo;s lifestyle, as well as the extravagance that helped fuel the rage leading to the revolution. Climb the great staircase and enter the jaw-dropping Hall of Mirrors, where the absolute ruler of France held court for the ambassadors of Siam, Persia and the Ottoman Empire, along with all the great seigneurs of France. Ladies intrigued behind their fans, plots were hatched, and careers were made and destroyed beneath the sparkling chandeliers here.</p>",

If you are experiencing Paris for the first time, this tour will introduce you to the City of Light&rsquo;s most cherished landmarks. You&rsquo;ll head via motorcoach from the Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by Napoleon to celebrate his Grand Army&rsquo;s 128 victories, down the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es to the Place de la Concorde. These broad 19th-century avenues and stately buildings were created by Baron Haussmann in a great urban development that eliminated the cramped, crazy-quilt medieval city and gave Paris its modern form. You&rsquo;ll pass the magnificent Op&eacute;ra Garnier, the Place Vend&ocirc;me (home to designer salons), the legendary Louvre and, on the Left Bank, the Sorbonne University and the Panth&eacute;on. Stretch your legs at the Luxembourg Gardens, then take in the &Eacute;cole Militaire before arriving at the manicured grounds of the Champs de Mars, the perfect vantage point from which to see Paris&rsquo;s most iconic structure&mdash;the Eiffel Tower. Cross the Seine via the most stunning single-arch bridge in Paris, Pont Alexandre III; it displays elegantly sculpted nymphs, winged horses and graceful art nouveau lamps. Once on the other side of the river, you&rsquo;ll be sure to spot the largest glass ceilings in France, which shelter the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais. As you continue along the Seine&rsquo;s banks you&rsquo;ll see many striking contemporary bridges too. Your city tour will finish at your ship&rsquo;s dock.</p>",

In fact, Notre Dame is officially the center of France; facing its main entrance is Kilometer Zero, the location from which distances in France (including those of the French national highways) are traditionally measured. An expert in the history and architecture of this magnificent cathedral will be your guide. Begun in the 12th century and finished about 200 years later, Notre Dame is one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in Europe.</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve admired Notre Dame&rsquo;s stained glass, flying buttresses and idiosyncratic gargoyles, cross the Archbishop&rsquo;s Bridge to the Left Bank and the Latin Quarter. Wander through the narrow streets where for centuries artists, writers, philosophers and the Sorbonne&rsquo;s students have lived and worked, argued politics, painted, sipped absinthe and lived the bohemian lifestyle for which the district is famous. Matisse, Picasso, Rimbaud and Sartre, as well as American expatriate writers Hemingway and Fitzgerald, are just a few of the notables who made this district home. Take some time to meander through the area&rsquo;s little squares, perusing the shop windows and perhaps relaxing with a drink at a classic caf&eacute;.</p>",

Enter the courtyard of the Gadagne Museum, which is housed in an early16th- century building, and stroll along Rue Juiverie, which has been occupied since Roman times and was once home to Nostradamus. You&rsquo;ll see some of the traboules, the old passageways that snake between and through buildings, secret shortcuts that silk weavers took to keep their delicate fabrics out of the rain.

This area was the heart of medieval Avignon (and the site of the original Roman town), crowded with cottages and narrow streets&mdash;until a pope had it all demolished in order to give his troops a clearer field of fire. That is Avignon in a nutshell: It was the city of the popes. The Avignon popes built the ramparts that still surround the Old Town and the huge, nearly impregnable fortress that dominates the UNESCO-designated district; in fact, the city did not officially become part of France until 1791. Stand below the high, thick walls to get a sense of just how daunting these fortifications were, then prepare to climb many steps as you tour the Palace of the Popes itself&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth it!</p>",

A thousand workers quarried 50,000 tons of soft golden limestone and used it to construct&mdash;without mortar&mdash;the magnificent tri-level bridge that still spans the river. An expert guide will explain the techniques used to build this engineering marvel, which has withstood 2,000 years of floods and storms that swept away much newer bridges. You can see notations those ancient Romans made in the stones as they cut and fitted them into place when you view the bridge itself, and you can learn about the entire project at the museum. The UNESCO World Heritage Site is as beautiful as it is fascinating.</p>",

Pause before the town hall, built with stone quarried from the Roman theater, and the Romanesque St. Trophime Church, which was erected in the 12th century. It replaced the church where St. Augustine, the man who converted the inhabitants of England to Christianity, was consecrated by the first archbishop of Canterbury. Walk in Van Gogh&rsquo;s footsteps past the cheery yellow Caf&eacute; de Nuit&mdash;still open and still the same shade of yellow it was when he painted it&mdash;and across Forum Square before visiting the town&rsquo;s bountiful farmers&rsquo; market, which displays seasonal fruits and vegetables, medicinal herbs and many more specialties of Southern France.</p>\n<p>During your free time after the tour, you can peruse the local shops, go olive tasting or delve further into Arles&rsquo; stunning collection of architectural treasures.</p>",

It&rsquo;s an ancient city boasting a remarkable collection of Roman ruins; among them are a theater where the famous&nbsp;Venus of Arles&mdash;on display in the Louvre&mdash;was discovered in 1651 and an amphitheater that is still used for sporting events. Join a local expert for a stroll through this district, where medieval houses crowd in among the ancient structures and the city gates date to the 13th century. Pause before the town hall, built with stone quarried from the Roman theater, and the Romanesque St. Trophime Church, which was erected in the 12th century. It replaced the church where St. Augustine, the man who converted the inhabitants of England to Christianity, was consecrated by the first archbishop of Canterbury. Walk in Van Gogh&rsquo;s footsteps past the cheery yellow Caf&eacute; de Nuit&mdash;still open and still the same shade of yellow it was when he painted it&mdash;and across Forum Square before visiting the town&rsquo;s bountiful farmers&rsquo; market, which displays seasonal fruits and vegetables, medicinal herbs and many more specialties of Southern France.</p>\n<p>During your free time after the tour, you can peruse the local shops, go olive tasting or delve further into Arles&rsquo; stunning collection of architectural treasures.</p>",

This area was the heart of medieval Avignon (and the site of the original Roman town), crowded with cottages and narrow streets&mdash;until a pope had it all demolished in order to give his troops a clearer field of fire. That is Avignon in a nutshell: It was the city of the popes. The Avignon popes built the ramparts that still surround the Old Town and the huge, nearly impregnable fortress that dominates the UNESCO-designated district; in fact, the city did not officially become part of France until 1791. Stand below the high, thick walls to get a sense of just how daunting these fortifications were, then prepare to climb many steps as you tour the Palace of the Popes itself&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth it!</p>",

A thousand workers quarried 50,000 tons of soft golden limestone and used it to construct&mdash;without mortar&mdash;the magnificent tri-level bridge that still spans the river. An expert guide will explain the techniques used to build this engineering marvel, which has withstood 2,000 years of floods and storms that swept away much newer bridges. You can see notations those ancient Romans made in the stones as they cut and fitted them into place when you view the bridge itself, and you can learn about the entire project at the museum.

Enter the courtyard of the Gadagne Museum, which is housed in an early 16th-century building, and stroll along Rue Juiverie, which has been occupied since Roman times and was once home to Nostradamus. You&rsquo;ll see some of the traboules, the old passageways that snake between and through buildings, secret shortcuts that silk weavers took to keep their delicate fabrics out of the rain.

Founded as a charitable institution by the duke&rsquo;s chancellor in 1443, the hospital became a model for charitable giving in southern France, one with a unique fundraising tradition that continues to this day. Over the centuries, the hospice monks were given wine and vineyards, and they began selling the wine at auction in order to support their charitable work. The wine auction is now world-famous, and the institution remains a working hospital for the poor, with modern facilities standing alongside the historic H&ocirc;tel-Dieu.After seeing H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, check out the farmers&rsquo; market, which spills from street to street in the Old Town. Cheeses, fruits, vegetables, local sausages, breads&mdash;all are on colorful display here. Browse and assemble your own picnic lunch or take advantage of one of the many delightful sidewalk caf&eacute;s for lunch.</p>\n<p><em>Note: The open-air farmers&rsquo; market visit will take place in Arles on the reverse direction cruise (Lyon to Avignon).</em></p>\n<p><em>Note:&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s lunch will be on your own.</em></p>",

                  "ExcursionDetails": "<p>From cave dwelling to fortress to castle to palace: This is the history of Ch&acirc;teau La Roche-Guyon (the Rock of Guy), which takes its name from its medieval lords (traditionally named Guy) and its location, a limestone outcropping&mdash;a rock&mdash;above the Seine. Medieval knights kept watch for marauding Vikings from the tower high atop the hill and later defended the double wall around a 13th-century manor house; successive lords added to the buildings over the centuries, so you can see not just troglodyte chapels but Renaissance rooms where kings Francis I and Henry II were entertained (and, legend says, Henry IV pursued a lovely chatelaine without success) and handsome 18th-century state apartments. Enlightenment thinkers met with the Duchess d&rsquo;Enville, who owned the ch&acirc;teau before the revolution and who had the huge kitchen garden laid out according to Enlightenment principles. You might think, as you walk through the elegantly designed garden and beautifully paneled rooms (mostly without furniture these days, so you can appreciate the Gobelins tapestries without distraction) that the residence&rsquo;s military function was in the far distant past, but Rommel made his headquarters here during WWII, precisely because the ancient fortifications and caves were so secure.</p>",

As you stroll through the grounds, you&rsquo;ll see the famed Japanese bridge and water garden shaded by weeping willows. Monet&rsquo;s house, which you will also visit, remains furnished as it was when the leader of the impressionist school lived here, complete with his precious collection of Japanese engravings.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Giverny will be closed during the March and November cruise departure dates.</em></p>",

Climb the great staircase and enter the jaw-dropping Hall of Mirrors, where the absolute ruler of France held court for the ambassadors of Siam, Persia and the Ottoman Empire, along with all the great seigneurs of France.

If you are experiencing Paris for the first time, this tour will introduce you to the City of Light&rsquo;s most cherished landmarks. You&rsquo;ll head via motorcoach from the Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by Napoleon to celebrate his Grand Army&rsquo;s 128 victories, down the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es to the Place de la Concorde. These broad 19th-century avenues and stately buildings were created by Baron Haussmann in a great urban development that eliminated the cramped, crazy-quilt medieval city and gave Paris its modern form. You&rsquo;ll pass the magnificent Op&eacute;ra Garnier, the Place Vend&ocirc;me (home to designer salons), the legendary Louvre and, on the Left Bank, the Sorbonne University and the Panth&eacute;on. Stretch your legs at the Luxembourg Gardens, then take in the &Eacute;cole Militaire before arriving at the manicured grounds of the Champs de Mars, the perfect vantage point from which to see Paris&rsquo;s most iconic structure&mdash;the Eiffel Tower. Cross the Seine via the most stunning single-arch bridge in Paris, Pont Alexandre III; it displays elegantly sculpted nymphs, winged horses and graceful art nouveau lamps. Once on the other side of the river, you&rsquo;ll be sure to spot the largest glass ceilings in France, which shelter the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais. As you continue along the Seine&rsquo;s banks you&rsquo;ll see many striking contemporary bridges too. Your city tour will finish at your ship&rsquo;s dock.</p>",

Henry IV said that Paris was worth a Mass when he converted to Catholicism&mdash;and he made that conversion official here, in the center of Paris. In fact, Notre Dame is officially the center of France; facing its main entrance is Kilometer Zero, the location from which distances in France (including those of the French national highways) are traditionally measured. An expert in the history and architecture of this magnificent cathedral will be your guide. Begun in the 12th century and finished about 200 years later, Notre Dame is one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in Europe.</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve admired Notre Dame&rsquo;s stained glass, flying buttresses and idiosyncratic gargoyles, cross the Archbishop&rsquo;s Bridge to the Left Bank and the Latin Quarter. Wander through the narrow streets where for centuries artists, writers, philosophers and the Sorbonne&rsquo;s students have lived and worked, argued politics, painted, sipped absinthe and lived the bohemian lifestyle for which the district is famous. Matisse, Picasso, Rimbaud and Sartre, as well as American expatriate writers Hemingway and Fitzgerald, are just a few of the notables who made this district home. Take some time to meander through the area&rsquo;s little squares, perusing the shop windows and perhaps relaxing with a drink at a classic caf&eacute;.</p>",

Bike to the Esplanade des Invalides (Napoleon&rsquo;s tomb is one of the monuments here) and along the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay to the Champs de Mars, one of Paris&rsquo;s largest green spaces . . . which just happens to have one of the best views of the Eiffel Tower in the city.

Many of these captains traveled to far-off places and returned with exotic plants, which they planted in their gardens and along the road (hence the route&rsquo;s name).

This fortress design was the one Vauban, Louis XIV&rsquo;s favorite military engineer, found most satisfactory, and he built some 300 of them in the Sun King&rsquo;s realm. The citadel contains the ruins of a medieval castle, houses, squares, streets, even a convent, all enclosed within stark walls. If you stand on top of those walls, you will have a terrific view of the estuary&mdash; this view was the field of fire, giving the citadel command of the river.</p>",

Today R&eacute;my Martin uses fine Champagne to produce its fine cognac, blending a variety of eaux de vie and aging them in oak barrels that might be 200 years old. (Remy Martin&rsquo;s legendary&mdash;and legendarily expensive&mdash; Louis XIII cognac has been called &ldquo;One Century in a Bottle&rdquo; precisely because of that extraordinary aging process.)

Of all the sights, however, perhaps the most extraordinary is the 12th-century church carved into a cliff. Only the tower is above ground; the rest of the church is subterranean. Its numerous underground galleries provided refuge during periods of strife, and include the grotto where St. &Eacute;milion, for whom the town is named, lived out his life in the ninth century. You have to see it for yourself&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be amazed by its almost unfathomable construction.

Though Bordeaux was the capital of Aquitaine in the Middle Ages and has its share of Gothic churches, it reached its apex in the 18th century. The splendid honey-colored stone buildings from this era make up a city core that UNESCO has designated a World Heritage Site (this is the district that inspired Baron Haussmann when he redesigned Paris at the behest of Napoleon III). Trade with the French colonies built this handsome district, furnishing vanilla, sugar, spices and cocoa to inventive chocolatiers and bakers, who used these goods to create iconic desserts. Chocolate, once a Spanish monopoly, became part of Bordeaux&rsquo; culinary heritage when banished Spanish Jews brought the art of chocolate-making to France. What are Bordeaux&rsquo; present-day residents enjoying when they step inside the luxurious food halls and elegant shops in this neighborhood? Find out as you sample the delicious handiwork of Bordeaux&rsquo; bakers, as well as cheeses and chocolates&mdash;learn a few recipes, too! You&rsquo;ll also visit one of the city&rsquo;s wine bars and see first-hand how the wines of the many local ch&acirc;teaux are enjoyed by today&rsquo;s sophisticated clients.</p>",

Medieval knights kept watch for marauding Vikings from the tower high atop the hill and later defended the double wall around a 13th-century manor house; successive lords added to the buildings over the centuries, so you can see not just troglodyte chapels but Renaissance rooms where kings Francis I and Henry II were entertained (and, legend says, Henry IV pursued a lovely chatelaine without success) and handsome 18th-century state apartments. Enlightenment thinkers met with the Duchess d&rsquo;Enville, who owned the ch&acirc;teau before the revolution and who had the huge kitchen garden laid out according to Enlightenment principles. You might think, as you walk through the elegantly designed garden and beautifully paneled rooms (mostly without furniture these days, so you can appreciate the Gobelins tapestries without distraction) that the residence&rsquo;s military function was in the far distant past, but Rommel made his headquarters here during WWII, precisely because the ancient fortifications and caves were so secure.</p>",

As you stroll through the grounds, you&rsquo;ll see the famed Japanese bridge and water garden shaded by weeping willows. Monet&rsquo;s house, which you will also visit, remains furnished as it was when the leader of the impressionist school lived here, complete with his precious collection of Japanese engravings.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Giverny will be closed during the March and November cruise departure dates.</em></p>",

If you are experiencing Paris for the first time, this tour will introduce you to the City of Light&rsquo;s most cherished landmarks. You&rsquo;ll head via motorcoach from the Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by Napoleon to celebrate his Grand Army&rsquo;s 128 victories, down the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es to the Place de la Concorde. These broad 19th-century avenues and stately buildings were created by Baron Haussmann in a great urban development that eliminated the cramped, crazy-quilt medieval city and gave Paris its modern form. You&rsquo;ll pass the magnificent Op&eacute;ra Garnier, the Place Vend&ocirc;me (home to designer salons), the legendary Louvre and, on the Left Bank, the Sorbonne University and the Panth&eacute;on. Stretch your legs at the Luxembourg Gardens, then take in the &Eacute;cole Militaire before arriving at the manicured grounds of the Champs de Mars, the perfect vantage point from which to see Paris&rsquo;s most iconic structure&mdash;the Eiffel Tower. Cross the Seine via the most stunning single-arch bridge in Paris, Pont Alexandre III; it displays elegantly sculpted nymphs, winged horses and graceful art nouveau lamps. Once on the other side of the river, you&rsquo;ll be sure to spot the largest glass ceilings in France, which shelter the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais. As you continue along the Seine&rsquo;s banks you&rsquo;ll see many striking contemporary bridges too. Your city tour will finish at your ship&rsquo;s dock.</p>",

In fact, Notre Dame is officially the center of France; facing its main entrance is Kilometer Zero, the location from which distances in France (including those of the French national highways) are traditionally measured. An expert in the history and architecture of this magnificent cathedral will be your guide. Begun in the 12th century and finished about 200 years later, Notre Dame is one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in Europe.</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve admired Notre Dame&rsquo;s stained glass, flying buttresses and idiosyncratic gargoyles, cross the Archbishop&rsquo;s Bridge to the Left Bank and the Latin Quarter. Wander through the narrow streets where for centuries artists, writers, philosophers and the Sorbonne&rsquo;s students have lived and worked, argued politics, painted, sipped absinthe and lived the bohemian lifestyle for which the district is famous. Matisse, Picasso, Rimbaud and Sartre, as well as American expatriate writers Hemingway and Fitzgerald, are just a few of the notables who made this district home. Take some time to meander through the area&rsquo;s little squares, perusing the shop windows and perhaps relaxing with a drink at a classic caf&eacute;.</p>",

The Romans built a bridge across the Saone here, and you&rsquo;ll have a great view of its 16th-century successor, the graceful multi-arched St. Laurent bridge, from the square. Ramble down Rue Monrevel for a look at the twin towers of St. Peter&rsquo;s, the church that replaced M&acirc;con&rsquo;s medieval&mdash;and irreparable&mdash;cathedral and then along bustling Rue Carnot, lined with shops and cafes, to a curious wooden house that predates the bridge: Maison de Bois&rsquo; facade is decorated with carved figures of men and monkeys&mdash;standing, sitting, holding onto mythical beasts.

Founded as a charitable institution by the duke&rsquo;s chancellor in 1443, the hospital became a model for charitable giving in southern France, one with a unique fundraising tradition that continues to this day. Over the centuries, the hospice monks were given wine and vineyards, and they began selling the wine at auction in order to support their charitable work. The wine auction is now world-famous, and the institution remains a working hospital for the poor, with modern facilities standing alongside the historic H&ocirc;tel-Dieu.</p>\n<p><em>Note:&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s lunch will be on your own.</em></p>",

Enter the courtyard of the Gadagne Museum, which is housed in an early16th- century building, and stroll along Rue Juiverie, which has been occupied since Roman times and was once home to Nostradamus.

This area was the heart of medieval Avignon (and the site of the original Roman town), crowded with cottages and narrow streets&mdash;until a pope had it all demolished in order to give his troops a clearer field of fire. That is Avignon in a nutshell: It was the city of the popes. The Avignon popes built the ramparts that still surround the Old Town and the huge, nearly impregnable fortress that dominates the UNESCO-designated district; in fact, the city did not officially become part of France until 1791. Stand below the high, thick walls to get a sense of just how daunting these fortifications were, then prepare to climb many steps as you tour the Palace of the Popes itself&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth it!</p>",

A thousand workers quarried 50,000 tons of soft golden limestone and used it to construct&mdash;without mortar&mdash;the magnificent tri-level bridge that still spans the river. An expert guide will explain the techniques used to build this engineering marvel, which has withstood 2,000 years of floods and storms that swept away much newer bridges. You can see notations those ancient Romans made in the stones as they cut and fitted them into place when you view the bridge itself, and you can learn about the entire project at the museum.

Many of these captains traveled to far-off places and returned with exotic plants, which they planted in their gardens and along the road (hence the route&rsquo;s name). But the history of these cliffs extends far beyond the 19th century&mdash;people have inhabited the area for thousands of years.</p>\n<p>Upon returning to Blaye, your guide will take you through the 17th-century demilune-shaped citadel built by famed military engineer Vauban. This fortress design was the one Vauban, Louis XIV&rsquo;s favorite military engineer, found most satisfactory, and he built some 300 of them in the Sun King&rsquo;s realm. The citadel contains the ruins of a medieval castle, houses, squares, streets, even a convent, all enclosed within stark walls. If you stand on top of those walls, you will have a terrific view of the estuary&mdash; this view was the field of fire, giving the citadel command of the river.</p>",

Today R&eacute;my Martin uses fine Champagne to produce its fine cognac, blending a variety of eaux de vie and aging them in oak barrels that might be 200 years old. (Remy Martin&rsquo;s legendary&mdash;and legendarily expensive&mdash; Louis XIII cognac has been called &ldquo;One Century in a Bottle&rdquo; precisely because of that extraordinary aging process.)

Of all the sights, however, perhaps the most extraordinary is the 12th-century church carved into a cliff. Only the tower is above ground; the rest of the church is subterranean. Its numerous underground galleries provided refuge during periods of strife, and include the grotto where St. &Eacute;milion, for whom the town is named, lived out his life in the ninth century. You have to see it for yourself&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be amazed by its almost unfathomable construction.

The splendid honey-colored stone buildings from this era make up a city core that UNESCO has designated a World Heritage Site (this is the district that inspired Baron Haussmann when he redesigned Paris at the behest of Napoleon III). Trade with the French colonies built this handsome district, furnishing vanilla, sugar, spices and cocoa to inventive chocolatiers and bakers, who used these goods to create iconic desserts. Chocolate, once a Spanish monopoly, became part of Bordeaux&rsquo; culinary heritage when banished Spanish Jews brought the art of chocolate-making to France. What are Bordeaux&rsquo; present-day residents enjoying when they step inside the luxurious food halls and elegant shops in this neighborhood? Find out as you sample the delicious handiwork of Bordeaux&rsquo; bakers, as well as cheeses and chocolates&mdash;learn a few recipes, too!

Medieval knights kept watch for marauding Vikings from the tower high atop the hill and later defended the double wall around a 13th-century manor house; successive lords added to the buildings over the centuries, so you can see not just troglodyte chapels but Renaissance rooms where kings Francis I and Henry II were entertained (and, legend says, Henry IV pursued a lovely chatelaine without success) and handsome 18th-century state apartments. Enlightenment thinkers met with the Duchess d&rsquo;Enville, who owned the ch&acirc;teau before the revolution and who had the huge kitchen garden laid out according to Enlightenment principles. You might think, as you walk through the elegantly designed garden and beautifully paneled rooms (mostly without furniture these days, so you can appreciate the Gobelins tapestries without distraction) that the residence&rsquo;s military function was in the far distant past, but Rommel made his headquarters here during WWII, precisely because the ancient fortifications and caves were so secure.</p>",

As you stroll through the grounds, you&rsquo;ll see the famed Japanese bridge and water garden shaded by weeping willows. Monet&rsquo;s house, which you will also visit, remains furnished as it was when the leader of the impressionist school lived here, complete with his precious collection of Japanese engravings.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Giverny will be closed during the March and November cruise departure dates.</em></p>",

If you are experiencing Paris for the first time, this tour will introduce you to the City of Light&rsquo;s most cherished landmarks. You&rsquo;ll head via motorcoach from the Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by Napoleon to celebrate his Grand Army&rsquo;s 128 victories, down the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es to the Place de la Concorde. These broad 19th-century avenues and stately buildings were created by Baron Haussmann in a great urban development that eliminated the cramped, crazy-quilt medieval city and gave Paris its modern form. You&rsquo;ll pass the magnificent Op&eacute;ra Garnier, the Place Vend&ocirc;me (home to designer salons), the legendary Louvre and, on the Left Bank, the Sorbonne University and the Panth&eacute;on. Stretch your legs at the Luxembourg Gardens, then take in the &Eacute;cole Militaire before arriving at the manicured grounds of the Champs de Mars, the perfect vantage point from which to see Paris&rsquo;s most iconic structure&mdash;the Eiffel Tower. Cross the Seine via the most stunning single-arch bridge in Paris, Pont Alexandre III; it displays elegantly sculpted nymphs, winged horses and graceful art nouveau lamps. Once on the other side of the river, you&rsquo;ll be sure to spot the largest glass ceilings in France, which shelter the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais. As you continue along the Seine&rsquo;s banks you&rsquo;ll see many striking contemporary bridges too. Your city tour will finish at your ship&rsquo;s dock.</p>",

Henry IV said that Paris was worth a Mass when he converted to Catholicism&mdash;and he made that conversion official here, in the center of Paris. In fact, Notre Dame is officially the center of France; facing its main entrance is Kilometer Zero, the location from which distances in France (including those of the French national highways) are traditionally measured. An expert in the history and architecture of this magnificent cathedral will be your guide. Begun in the 12th century and finished about 200 years later, Notre Dame is one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in Europe.</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve admired Notre Dame&rsquo;s stained glass, flying buttresses and idiosyncratic gargoyles, cross the Archbishop&rsquo;s Bridge to the Left Bank and the Latin Quarter. Wander through the narrow streets where for centuries artists, writers, philosophers and the Sorbonne&rsquo;s students have lived and worked, argued politics, painted, sipped absinthe and lived the bohemian lifestyle for which the district is famous. Matisse, Picasso, Rimbaud and Sartre, as well as American expatriate writers Hemingway and Fitzgerald, are just a few of the notables who made this district home. Take some time to meander through the area&rsquo;s little squares, perusing the shop windows and perhaps relaxing with a drink at a classic caf&eacute;.</p>",
